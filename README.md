This repository contains an implementation of a tree object as well as a test of that object.

Binary trees with `Node`,`insert`,`search` are implemented in `binary_tree.py`; associated tests in `test_binary_tree.py`.

Datasets and a script for creating datasets in `create_data.py`, `sorted_data.txt`, `unsorted_data.txt`.

A script to test insert speed for hash and trees is located in `insert_key_value_pairs.py`.
Run using `python insert_key_value_pairs.py --data_structure 'tree'.

Insert time for hash: 
Sorted: 8.76 sec
Unsorted: 7.85 sec

Insert time for tree:
Sorted: 0.016026 sec
Unsorted: 0.01600 sec
